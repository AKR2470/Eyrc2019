E-YANTRA 2018-19 Theme - Ant Bot
![Theme](https://github.com/AKR2470/Eyrc2019/blob/master/Images/AntBot.png)
Marching along the jungle safari are the “Ants” that keep the jungle going. We can’t help but notice their method of work viz. cooperation and coordination - the essential aspects of teamwork. Here we have tried to isolate the work of a single ant in this year’s Ant Bot (AB) theme. 

An Ant collects and provides food for not just itself but also its community while leaving a trail or path to the resources for the other ants to follow suit. The Arena is so designed such that the first ant has left a black path behind for the other teammates. Thus, your bot is the teammate AB. 

The tasks to be done by the AB across the arena are the same as the first ant i.e. collecting leaves, honey, wood from the Shrubs Area (SA) and store for winter and/or remove trash from its Ant Hills (AH). One of the Ant Hill, the Queen Ant’s Hill (QAH) is always given preferential treatment while doing the service. 

### *The challenges in this theme include Line Following using a sensor, colour image processing and AH detection and service assessment using a Camera; in addition to these there is also a pick and place mechanism.*
